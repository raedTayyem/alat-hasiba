3. **Outgrow** - Interactive content, $14-720/month

- They require clients to build calculators themselves
- You provide pre-built, industry-specific suites
- Higher price point but full service
- Better for clients without technical teams

### Indirect Competitors

---

## Pricing Psychology

### Why $997-$25,000 Works

**Value Perception**:
- Custom calculator development: $5k-$50k
- Your service: $1k-$15k (50-80% discount vs custom)
- Perceived value: 5-10x price paid

**Payment Psychology**:
- Businesses budget differently than consumers
- $3k is "small project" budget for SMBs
- $10k is "medium project" for enterprises
- Can approve without board/executive
- Often have "marketing" or "tech" budget for this

**Pricing Tiers Create Anchoring**:
- Tier 1 at $997 makes Tier 2 at $2,997 seem reasonable
- Most will choose Tier 2 (middle option bias)
- Tier 4 at $25k makes Tier 3 at $10k look like bargain

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: "Why don't clients just copy the calculators?"
**Mitigation**:
- Obfuscate/minify code
- License agreement with legal terms
- Hosted solution (no code access for Tier 1-3)

- Niche down by industry initially (real estate, finance)
- Build relationships and referrals
- Provide exceptional support
- Continuous calculator expansion

### Risk 3: "Clients want custom features"
**Mitigation**:
- Charge premium for custom work ($5k-15k)
- Build common custom requests into library
- Partner with dev shop for overflow
- Set clear boundaries on scope
- Upsell Tier 4 for full customization

### Risk 4: "Can't scale delivery"
**Mitigation**:
- Automate from day 1
- Document everything
- Build deployment pipeline

1. **You already built the product** (266 calculators)
2. **10-100x price increase** ($30 template → $3,000 service)
3. **Fewer customers needed** (10 vs 1,000)
4. **Higher margins** (90%+ vs 70% for templates)
5. **Recurring revenue** (annual renewals, support contracts)
6. **Scalable with automation**
7. **Multiple target markets** (not dependent on one industry)
8. **Defensible** (service + relationships + continuous improvement)

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Pick your first niche** (recommend: real estate or finance)
2. **Create Tier 1 & 2 offerings** (simplest to deliver)
3. **Build simple landing page** (can use your existing site)
