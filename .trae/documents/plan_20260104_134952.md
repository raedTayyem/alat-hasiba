# Phase 1: Fix Number Input Icon Positioning (RTL/LTR)
**Root Cause:** The current `NumberInput` doesn't handle RTL/LTR icon placement correctly.

1.  **Update `src/components/ui/number-input.tsx`:**
    *   **Icon Logic:** Ensure that `startIcon` (like a currency symbol or weight icon) is placed on the **left** in LTR mode and on the **right** in RTL mode. Use logical properties (`start-0`, `end-0`) and padding (`ps-10`, `pe-10`) that automatically flip.
    *   **Button Logic:** Ensure the `-` button is always on the logical "start" side and the `+` button is on the logical "end" side. The current design already does this with `rounded-s-2xl` and `rounded-e-2xl`, but the internal input padding needs to be double-checked.

# Phase 2: Remove Website Name & Contact Sections
**Root Cause:** User wants to remove the website name from all UI elements and the entire "Contact Us" section.

1.  **Header (`src/components/Header.tsx`):**
    *   Remove the `<span>` containing `t('siteName')` next to the logo. Keep only the logo image.
    *   Remove the "Contact" link from both Desktop and Mobile navigation.

2.  **Footer (`src/components/Footer.tsx`):**
    *   Remove the `<span>` containing `t('siteName')` next to the logo. Keep only the logo image.
    *   Remove the entire "Contact info" `<div>` block (lines 97-123).
    *   Remove the `SocialLink` components (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) as they are hardcoded and not needed.

3.  **Privacy Policy & Terms Pages:**
    *   Search for any hardcoded contact email (`contact@alathasiba.com`) or contact forms and remove them.

# Phase 3: Redesign Logo & Create Category Icons
**Root Cause:** User wants a unique SVG logo and category-specific icons.

1.  **Create New Logo SVG:**
    *   Design a modern, minimalist SVG logo (e.g., a stylized calculator or geometric shape).
    *   Replace the current `<img src="/الات حاسبه.png">` in both `Header.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` with this new SVG.
    *   Ensure the SVG has a `viewBox` and scales well. Add `fill="currentColor"` so it inherits `text-foreground` color.

2.  **Create Category SVG Icons:**
    *   Create a set of unique, minimalist SVG icons for the main categories (Math, Finance, Health, Converter, etc.).
    *   Store these in a new file, e.g., `src/components/icons/CategoryIcons.tsx`.
    *   Update the `HomePage.tsx` category grid to use these new SVGs instead of the generic `Layers` icon.

# Phase 4: Make Search Input Bigger in Header
**Root Cause:** The search input in the header is too small.

1.  **Update `src/components/Header.tsx`:**
    *   Change the width of the search container from `w-64` to something larger, like `w-80` or `w-96`, or make it fluid with `flex-1 max-w-2xl`.
    *   Ensure this change applies to both desktop and the mobile overlay search.

# Phase 5: Final Translation Audit & Fixes
**Root Cause:** User reports "a lot of untranslated keys".

1.  **Re-run Audit:** Re-run the audit script to find any keys that were missed or newly introduced.
2.  **Manual Review:** Manually check high-traffic pages (Home, Category, Calculator) for any remaining hardcoded English text or symbols (like the hardcoded `★` in `CalculatorLayout.tsx`).
3.  **Update JSON Files:** Add any newly found keys to `en/translation.json` and `ar/translation.json` with appropriate fallback text.
