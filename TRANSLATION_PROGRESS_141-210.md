- **Total translation keys added:** ~538 keys (EN + AR)
- **Average completion:** ~97%

## Remaining Work

Calculators 158-210 still require translation completion:
- green-commute-calculator (Calculator 158)
- greenhouse-calculator (Calculator 159)
- gross-rent-multiplier-calculator (Calculator 160)
- grout-calculator (Calculator 161)
- half-life-calculator (Calculator 162)
- ... and 48 more calculators

## Next Steps

To complete the remaining 54 calculators:
1. Extract translation keys from component source files
2. Create EN translations following established patterns
3. Create AR translations with proper Arabic localization
4. Test and verify all translations load correctly
5. Run verification script to confirm 100% coverage
