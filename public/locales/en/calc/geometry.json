        "question": "When should I use Polar coordinates instead of Cartesian?",
        "answer": "Use Polar coordinates when dealing with circular motion, rotation, waves, or any problem with radial symmetry. If something naturally involves angles and distances from a center point, Polar coordinates will simplify your calculations."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between degrees and radians?",
        "answer": "Degrees divide a full circle into 360 parts, while radians measure angle by the arc length divided by radius. A full circle is 360° or 2π radians. To convert: radians = degrees × (π/180), degrees = radians × (180/π)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why use atan2 instead of regular arctan?",
        "answer": "The regular arctan function only returns values between -90° and 90°, losing information about which quadrant the point is in. The atan2(y, x) function takes both coordinates separately and correctly determines the angle for all four quadrants."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens at the origin (0, 0)?",
        "answer": "At the origin, the polar radius r equals 0, but the angle θ is undefined since there's no unique direction from a point to itself. Most calculators will return 0 or leave the angle undefined for this special case."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can polar coordinates have negative values?",
        "answer": "The radius r is conventionally non-negative. Negative angles are allowed and represent clockwise rotation from the positive x-axis. Some advanced applications allow negative r, which reflects the point through the origin."
