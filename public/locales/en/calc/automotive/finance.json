        "question": "What is a good interest rate for a car loan?",
        "answer": "Good rates vary by credit score and market conditions. Generally, excellent credit (750+) can get 4-6% APR for new cars, good credit (700-749) around 6-9%, and fair credit (650-699) may see 9-14%. Used car rates are typically 1-2% higher."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I choose a longer loan term for lower payments?",
        "answer": "While longer terms lower monthly payments, they significantly increase total interest paid. A 72-month loan at 6% on $25,000 costs about $2,500 more in interest than a 48-month loan. Only extend terms if necessary for affordability."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much should I put down on a car?",
        "answer": "Experts recommend at least 20% down for new cars and 10% for used cars. This reduces your loan amount, lowers monthly payments, and helps prevent being underwater on the loan if the car depreciates."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does trading in my old car help?",
        "answer": "Trade-in value reduces the amount you need to finance, lowering your loan amount and potentially your interest paid. However, selling privately often yields more money than trade-in value."
      },
      {
        "question": "What fees should I expect when financing a car?",
        "answer": "Common fees include documentation fees ($100-500), registration fees, title fees, and dealer prep fees. Some are negotiable. Sales tax varies by state and is calculated on the purchase price minus trade-in in most states."

        "question": "What coverage do I actually need?",
        "answer": "At minimum, liability coverage (required by law). If you have a loan, lender requires collision and comprehensive. For older cars worth little, you might drop collision coverage. Always carry enough liability to protect your assets."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does my age affect insurance rates?",
        "answer": "Drivers under 25 pay significantly more due to higher accident rates. Rates typically decrease from 25-65, then may increase slightly for seniors. A 20-year-old might pay 2-3x what a 40-year-old pays for identical coverage."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I choose a higher deductible?",
        "answer": "If you can afford to pay the deductible if needed, higher deductibles save money. Moving from $500 to $1000 deductible might save 15-30% on collision coverage. Just ensure you have the deductible amount saved."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I drop collision coverage?",
        "answer": "Consider dropping when annual collision premium exceeds 10% of car value. On a $3000 car, if collision costs $400/year, you might be better self-insuring since payouts would be minimal anyway."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often should I shop for insurance?",
        "answer": "At least annually at renewal time. Rates change, and you might qualify for new discounts. Getting 3-5 quotes takes minimal time and can save hundreds of dollars per year."

        "question": "Why compare 5-year costs instead of just price?",
        "answer": "A cheaper car might cost more to own due to worse fuel economy, higher maintenance, or faster depreciation. 5 years captures several years of ownership costs while most people still own the vehicle."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the depreciation estimate?",
        "answer": "The calculator uses an average 50% depreciation over 5 years. Actual depreciation varies by make, model, and market conditions. Trucks and some brands depreciate slower; luxury cars often depreciate faster."
      },
      {
        "question": "What maintenance costs should I include?",
        "answer": "Include oil changes, tires, brakes, and routine services. For used cars, add potential repair costs. Luxury and European cars typically have higher maintenance costs than Japanese or Korean vehicles."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I include insurance in the comparison?",
        "answer": "Yes, if you know the rates. Insurance varies significantly by vehicle - sports cars and luxury vehicles typically cost more to insure than family sedans or economy cars."
