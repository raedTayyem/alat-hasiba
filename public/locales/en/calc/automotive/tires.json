        "answer": "Within limits, yes. Generally, you can increase overall diameter by about 3% without major issues. Larger increases may require lift kits, fender modifications, or recalibration of speedometer and possibly ABS systems."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the plus sizing concept?",
        "answer": "Plus sizing increases rim diameter while decreasing sidewall height to maintain the same overall diameter. Plus 1 means 1 inch larger rims. This improves handling but may reduce ride comfort. Keep overall diameter within 3% of original."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I read tire revolutions per mile?",

      "title": "How Wheel Offset Calculation Works",
      "formula": "Backspacing = (Wheel Width / 2) + (Offset / 25.4)",
      "explanation": "Wheel offset is the distance in millimeters from the wheel's centerline to its mounting surface. Positive offset means the mounting surface is toward the front (street side), while negative offset pushes the wheel outward for a wider stance.",
      "steps": [
        "Choose your calculation mode (from offset or backspacing)",
        "Enter the wheel width in inches",
        "Enter the offset in mm or backspacing in inches",
        "View calculated measurements and fitment information"

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between offset and backspacing?",
        "answer": "Offset measures from the wheel centerline to the mounting surface in millimeters. Backspacing measures from the back edge of the wheel to the mounting surface in inches. Both describe where the wheel sits relative to the hub."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will changing offset affect my handling?",
        "answer": "Yes, changing offset alters your vehicle's scrub radius, which can affect steering feel, tire wear, and handling characteristics. Staying within 5-10mm of stock offset is generally recommended for daily drivers."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much offset change is safe?",
        "answer": "Most vehicles can safely accommodate 5-15mm offset change from stock. Larger changes may require fender modifications, may cause rubbing, or could stress wheel bearings and suspension components."
      },
      {
        "question": "What offset do I need for a flush fitment?",
        "answer": "Flush fitment depends on your fender width and tire size. Generally, you want the tire edge to align with or sit slightly inside the fender. This typically requires lower offset (more negative) than stock for most vehicles."
