    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How much can I save with a hybrid?",
        "answer": "Savings depend on driving patterns and gas prices. A typical hybrid saves $500-1,500 per year over comparable gas vehicles. City drivers see the biggest savings; highway-only drivers may see minimal benefit."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it take to pay off the hybrid premium?",
        "answer": "With typical $2,000-4,000 premiums and $800-1,200 annual savings, payback takes 2-5 years. High-mileage drivers in cities with expensive gas see faster payback."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do hybrids need special maintenance?",
        "answer": "Regular maintenance is similar to conventional cars. Hybrid batteries typically last 150,000+ miles and are covered by 8-10 year warranties. Brake wear is often less due to regenerative braking."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are hybrids worth it for highway driving?",
        "answer": "Hybrids provide less benefit on highways where regenerative braking isn't used. The fuel economy advantage may only be 10-15% on highways versus 30-50% in city driving."
