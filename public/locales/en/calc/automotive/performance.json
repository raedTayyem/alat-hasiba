      {
        "question": "What is average reaction time?",
        "answer": "Average reaction time is 1.5 seconds for alert drivers. However, it can increase to 2-3 seconds or more if tired, distracted, or impaired. At 60 mph, each second of reaction time adds 88 feet to stopping distance."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much of stopping distance is reaction distance?",
        "answer": "At highway speeds, reaction distance is often more than half of total stopping distance. At 60 mph with 1.5-second reaction, you travel 132 feet before even touching the brakes."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do grades affect stopping distance?",
        "answer": "Downhill grades significantly increase stopping distance as gravity works against brakes. A 10% downhill grade can increase stopping distance by 20-30% or more."

      {
        "question": "Why do trucks need more stopping distance?",
        "answer": "Heavy vehicles have much more momentum to dissipate. A loaded semi-truck at 65 mph needs about 525 feet to stop - nearly twice the distance of a car. This is why trucks maintain longer following distances."

        "question": "How much does a 10% grade affect stopping distance?",
        "answer": "A 10% downhill grade can increase stopping distance by 20-30% or more. On steep grades with poor traction, the increase is even more dramatic. Always reduce speed significantly before descending steep grades."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is brake fade and how do I prevent it?",
        "answer": "Brake fade occurs when brakes overheat and lose effectiveness. Prevent it by using engine braking (lower gears) on long descents, giving brakes time to cool, and not riding the brakes. If you smell burning brakes, pull over safely and let them cool."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I use lower gears going downhill?",
        "answer": "Yes. Engine braking in lower gears reduces brake use and prevents overheating. Use a gear that maintains a safe speed without constant braking. Most automatic transmissions have L or numbered positions for this purpose."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do grades affect trucks differently than cars?",
        "answer": "Heavy vehicles have much more kinetic energy to dissipate when braking. A loaded truck on a steep grade may have 2-3x the stopping distance of a car. Truck escape ramps exist because runaway trucks cannot stop on steep grades."
