      {
        "question": "Why is my actual fuel economy lower than the EPA rating?",

        "answer": "EVs have zero tailpipe emissions but the electricity source matters. In areas with clean grids, EVs are significantly cleaner. Even with coal-heavy grids, EVs are usually cleaner due to power plant efficiency."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I reduce my vehicle's carbon emissions?",
        "answer": "Improve fuel economy through smooth driving, proper maintenance, and correct tire pressure. Consider carpooling, combining trips, or switching to a more efficient or electric vehicle."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a carbon offset?",
        "answer": "Carbon offsets fund projects that reduce CO2 elsewhere (tree planting, renewable energy, etc.) to compensate for your emissions. Typical car emissions cost $50-200/year to offset."
