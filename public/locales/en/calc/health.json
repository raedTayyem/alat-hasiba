      {
        "question": "How is BMI calculated and what does it measure?",
        "answer": "BMI is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in meters squared (BMI = kg/m²). For example, a person weighing 70 kg with a height of 1.75 m has a BMI of 22.9. It measures the relationship between weight and height to indicate whether you're underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is considered a healthy BMI range?",
        "answer": "A healthy BMI range is typically between 18.5 and 24.9. Below 18.5 is classified as underweight, 25-29.9 is overweight, and 30 or above indicates obesity. However, these ranges may vary slightly based on age, gender, and ethnic background."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is BMI an accurate measure for everyone?",
        "answer": "BMI is a useful screening tool but has limitations. It may overestimate body fat in muscular athletes and underestimate it in older adults who have lost muscle mass. For a complete health assessment, consider additional measures like waist circumference, body fat percentage, and overall fitness level."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often should I check my BMI?",
        "answer": "For general health monitoring, checking your BMI once a month is sufficient. If you're actively working on weight management, weekly measurements can help track progress. Always measure under consistent conditions for accurate comparisons."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can children and teenagers use this BMI calculator?",
        "answer": "Standard BMI calculations apply differently to children and teenagers because their body composition changes as they grow. For individuals under 18, BMI should be interpreted using age and gender-specific percentile charts, ideally with guidance from a pediatrician."

      },
      {
        "question": "How many calories should I cut to lose weight safely?",
        "answer": "A deficit of 500 calories per day typically results in approximately 0.5 kg (1 pound) of weight loss per week, which is considered a safe and sustainable rate. Deficits greater than 1000 calories daily are generally not recommended as they can lead to muscle loss and nutritional deficiencies."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are these calorie calculations 100% accurate?",
        "answer": "These are scientifically-based estimates that work well for most people, but individual responses vary based on genetics, metabolism, and other factors. Use them as a reliable starting point and adjust based on your actual results over 2-4 weeks."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I eat back the calories I burn during exercise?",
        "answer": "It depends on your goals. For weight loss, eating back only 50-75% of exercise calories is often recommended since calorie burn estimates can be inflated. For maintenance or muscle building, you may need to consume most or all of those additional calories."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I know if I'm eating the right amount of calories?",
        "answer": "Monitor your weight weekly and track trends over 2-4 weeks. If you're losing about 0.5 kg per week on a weight loss plan, or maintaining stable weight on maintenance calories, your intake is likely appropriate. Adjust by 100-200 calories if progress stalls."

        "question": "Can I consume too much protein?",
        "answer": "Yes, but excess protein beyond your needs is typically converted to energy or stored as fat. Healthy kidneys can process substantial amounts of protein, but individuals with existing kidney conditions should consult their healthcare provider about appropriate limits."

        "question": "What are the best sources of protein?",

        "question": "How much protein can my body absorb per meal?",
        "answer": "Research suggests that 20-40 grams of high-quality protein per meal optimally stimulates muscle protein synthesis. Consuming more in a single meal is not harmful but may not provide additional muscle-building benefits."

        "question": "Does water temperature matter for hydration?",
