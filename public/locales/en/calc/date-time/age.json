        "question": "How is age calculated in years, months, and days?",
        "answer": "Age is calculated by finding the difference between your birth date and today's date. First, we count complete years, then remaining months, and finally remaining days. For example, if born on March 15, 2000, and today is January 10, 2024, you would be 23 years, 9 months, and 26 days old."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are leap years handled in age calculation?",
        "answer": "Our calculator accounts for leap years (years divisible by 4, except century years not divisible by 400). February 29th birthdays are calculated correctly, and the extra day in leap years is included in the total day count."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between chronological age and biological age?",
        "answer": "Chronological age is your exact age based on your birth date. Biological age reflects how well your body functions compared to average people of your chronological age. This calculator determines chronological age; biological age requires medical assessments."

        "question": "Why is my lunar age different from my solar age?",
        "answer": "The lunar year (Hijri) is about 11 days shorter than the solar year (Gregorian), so your lunar age will be higher than your Gregorian age."
