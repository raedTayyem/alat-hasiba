      "explanation": "This converter transforms time from one timezone to another using UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) offsets. It automatically accounts for daylight saving time when applicable in certain regions, ensuring accurate conversions year-round.",

      {
        "question": "What is UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)?",
        "answer": "UTC is the global time standard against which all time zones are measured. It was formerly known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I find the time difference between two countries?",
        "answer": "Enter the same time in the calculator and convert between both zones. The time difference will be apparent from the result."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the time difference change throughout the year?",
        "answer": "Yes, some countries observe daylight saving time which changes the time difference with other countries by one hour."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do some timezones have 30-minute or 45-minute offsets?",
        "answer": "Some countries and regions have chosen non-standard timezone offsets for political, geographical, or historical reasons. Examples include India (UTC+5:30) and Nepal (UTC+5:45)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens when converting across the International Date Line?",
        "answer": "When converting time across the International Date Line (roughly 180° longitude), the date changes by one day. Moving west adds a day, moving east subtracts a day."
