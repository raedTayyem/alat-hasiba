        "question": "Why is extension force greater than retraction force?",
        "answer": "During extension, pressure acts on the full piston area. During retraction, the rod area is subtracted from the piston area, reducing effective area and resulting force."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I select the right cylinder size?",
        "answer": "Determine required force and available system pressure. Area = Force / Pressure. Then calculate piston diameter from the area. Add 20-30% safety factor."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a safe operating pressure?",
        "answer": "Safe pressure is typically 70-80% of test pressure. Standard cylinders operate at 160-250 bar, heavy-duty cylinders reach 400-700 bar."
