      {
        "question": "What is residual value in a lease?",
        "answer": "Residual value is the estimated worth of the asset at the end of the lease term. For vehicles, it's typically 50-60% of MSRP for a 3-year lease. Higher residual values result in lower monthly payments because you're paying for less depreciation."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is the money factor calculated?",
        "answer": "Money factor is the interest rate expressed as a decimal divided by 2400. For example, a 6% APR becomes a money factor of 0.0025 (6% / 2400). To convert money factor to APR, multiply by 2400."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I make a down payment on a lease?",
        "answer": "Down payments (capitalized cost reduction) lower monthly payments but increase upfront costs. Consider the trade-off: if the vehicle is totaled, you lose your down payment. Some prefer minimal down payment for maximum flexibility."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens at the end of a lease?",
        "answer": "You typically have three options: (1) Return the vehicle and walk away, (2) Purchase it for the residual value plus any fees, or (3) Lease or buy a new vehicle. Inspect for excess wear and mileage charges before returning."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is leasing better than buying?",
        "answer": "Leasing offers lower monthly payments, warranty coverage, and the ability to drive new vehicles every few years. Buying builds equity and has no mileage restrictions. The best choice depends on your driving habits, budget, and preferences."
