      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use accelerated depreciation?",
        "answer": "When you want larger tax deductions early, or when assets lose value quickly in early years (vehicles, technology). Matches expense to actual value decline."

      {
        "question": "What is MACRS depreciation?",
        "answer": "Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System - the US tax method. IRS specifies recovery periods and depreciation rates for different asset classes."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does depreciation affect taxes?",
        "answer": "Depreciation is a non-cash expense that reduces taxable income. Higher depreciation means lower taxes but also lower reported profit."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I depreciate land?",
        "answer": "No. Land doesn't wear out so it cannot be depreciated. Only buildings and improvements on land are depreciable."
