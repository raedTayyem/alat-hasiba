        "question": "What is diversity factor?",
        "answer": "Diversity factor accounts for loads not running simultaneously. A home might have 30kW of loads but only 15kW peak demand. Diversity = Peak / Total, typically 0.4-0.8."

      {
        "question": "How do I size the main breaker?",
        "answer": "Calculate total demand with diversity factor, add 25% for continuous loads, then select next standard breaker size up. Always follow local electrical codes."
      },
      {
        "question": "What cable size do I need?",
        "answer": "Cable size depends on current, distance, and installation method. Use ampacity tables from NEC/IEC, derate for temperature and bundling, and check voltage drop."
