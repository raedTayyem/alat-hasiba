    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How many bags of cement do I need per cubic meter of concrete?",
        "answer": "For a standard 1:2:4 mix ratio, you need approximately 6-7 bags of 50kg cement per cubic meter of concrete. This calculator automatically determines the exact quantity based on your project dimensions."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the standard concrete mix ratio?",
        "answer": "The most common mix ratio is 1:2:4 (cement:sand:aggregate by volume). This produces concrete suitable for most residential and light commercial applications with adequate strength."
      },
      {
        "question": "How thick should a concrete slab be?",
        "answer": "Residential patios and walkways require 7-10cm thickness. Driveways need 10-15cm for car traffic. Heavy vehicle areas require 15-20cm with proper reinforcement."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does concrete weigh per cubic meter?",
        "answer": "Standard concrete weighs approximately 2400 kg per cubic meter (150 lbs per cubic foot). Lightweight concrete weighs around 1800 kg/m³."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I mix concrete by hand for small projects?",
        "answer": "Yes, for projects under 0.5 cubic meters, hand mixing is feasible. For larger projects, consider renting a concrete mixer or ordering ready-mix concrete delivery."
