        "question": "How do I determine the correct bar spacing?",
        "answer": "Bar spacing depends on bird size: finches and canaries need 1/4 to 1/2 inch spacing, budgies and lovebirds need 1/2 inch, cockatiels need 1/2 to 5/8 inch, and larger parrots need 3/4 to 1 inch or more. Incorrect spacing can lead to head entrapment or escape."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can different bird species share the same cage?",
        "answer": "Some species can cohabitate if they have similar sizes and temperaments. However, you must significantly increase cage size and provide multiple feeding stations. Never house aggressive species together, and always research species compatibility before mixing."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often should I clean the bird cage?",
        "answer": "Daily spot cleaning of droppings and food debris is essential. Weekly thorough cleaning includes washing perches and toys. Monthly deep cleaning involves disinfecting the entire cage. A clean environment prevents disease and promotes bird health."
