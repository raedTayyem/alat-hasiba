        "question": "What is the difference between offset and backspacing?",
        "answer": "Offset is measured from the wheel centerline to the mounting surface in millimeters. Backspacing is measured from the back edge of the wheel to the mounting surface in inches. They describe the same thing from different reference points."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does positive vs negative offset mean?",
        "answer": "Positive offset: mounting surface is toward the street side (most passenger cars). Negative offset: mounting surface is toward the inside, pushing the wheel outward (trucks, deep dish wheels). Zero offset: mounting surface is at centerline."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much offset change is safe?",
        "answer": "For daily driving, stay within 5-10mm of stock offset to maintain proper handling and avoid clearance issues. Larger changes may require fender modifications and can stress wheel bearings."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will changing offset affect my handling?",
        "answer": "Yes. Offset changes alter scrub radius, which affects steering feel, stability, and tire wear patterns. Lower offset widens track width, which can improve grip but may cause tramlining on grooved roads."

        "question": "What do the numbers in a tire size mean?",
        "answer": "In 225/65R17: 225 is the width in mm, 65 is the aspect ratio (sidewall height as percentage of width), R means radial construction, and 17 is the rim diameter in inches. A higher aspect ratio means a taller sidewall."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does tire size affect my speedometer?",
        "answer": "Larger diameter tires cover more ground per revolution, making your speedometer read slower than actual speed. A 3% larger tire means when your speedo shows 60 mph, you're actually going about 62 mph. The odometer is similarly affected."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I put larger tires on my car?",
        "answer": "Within limits, yes. Generally, you can increase overall diameter by about 3% without major issues. Larger increases may require lift kits, fender modifications, or recalibration of speedometer and possibly ABS systems."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the plus sizing concept?",
        "answer": "Plus sizing increases rim diameter while decreasing sidewall height to maintain the same overall diameter. Plus 1 means 1 inch larger rims. This improves handling but may reduce ride comfort. Keep overall diameter within 3% of original."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I read tire revolutions per mile?",
        "answer": "Revolutions per mile tells you how many times the tire rotates in one mile. Lower numbers mean larger tires. Stock tires are calibrated for your speedometer; different revolutions mean speedometer error."

      {
        "question": "What is the difference between lb-ft and Nm?",
        "answer": "Both measure torque. lb-ft (pound-feet) is common in the US, while Nm (Newton-meters) is the metric/SI unit used internationally. 1 lb-ft = 1.356 Nm, so multiply lb-ft by 1.356 to get Nm."

        "question": "How much does a 10% grade affect stopping distance?",
        "answer": "A 10% downhill grade can increase stopping distance by 20-30% or more. On steep grades with poor traction, the increase is even more dramatic. Always reduce speed significantly before descending steep grades."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is brake fade and how do I prevent it?",
        "answer": "Brake fade occurs when brakes overheat and lose effectiveness. Prevent it by using engine braking (lower gears) on long descents, giving brakes time to cool, and not riding the brakes. If you smell burning brakes, pull over safely and let them cool."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I use lower gears going downhill?",
        "answer": "Yes. Engine braking in lower gears reduces brake use and prevents overheating. Use a gear that maintains a safe speed without constant braking. Most automatic transmissions have L or numbered positions for this purpose."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do grades affect trucks differently than cars?",
        "answer": "Heavy vehicles have much more kinetic energy to dissipate when braking. A loaded truck on a steep grade may have 2-3x the stopping distance of a car. Truck escape ramps exist because runaway trucks cannot stop on steep grades."

      {
        "question": "How does down payment affect my loan?",
