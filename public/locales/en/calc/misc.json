                "answer": "European sizes use the Paris point system, where each size represents 2/3 cm (about 6.67mm). Unlike US/UK systems, EU sizes are unisex - the same EU size fits the same foot length regardless of gender."

                "question": "Why does my shoe size vary between brands?",
                "answer": "There's no universal standard enforced across manufacturers. Each brand develops their own lasts (foot molds) and may interpret size standards differently. Athletic brands often run larger, while Italian shoes often run smaller."

            {
                "question": "What is the most accurate way to find my shoe size?",
                "answer": "Measure your foot length in centimeters (CM) from heel to longest toe while standing. This measurement can be most reliably converted to any sizing system. Measure both feet, as they may differ."

                "question": "Should I buy shoes in my exact size or go larger?",
                "answer": "For everyday shoes, your measured size should work. For athletic shoes, especially running shoes, consider going half a size larger to accommodate foot swelling during activity. For dress shoes, true to size is usually best."
