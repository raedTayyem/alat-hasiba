      {
        "question": "Why do clothing sizes vary so much between brands?",
        "answer": "There's no universal sizing standard. Brands use different fit models, vanity sizing practices, and target demographics, leading to significant variations even within the same country."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between UK and EU sizes?",
        "answer": "Despite both being European, UK sizes differ from EU sizes. Generally, UK sizes are 2-4 numbers lower than EU sizes (UK 12 ≈ EU 40). Always specify which system you're using."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are men's sizes more consistent than women's?",
        "answer": "Generally yes. Men's pants often use waist and inseam measurements (inches/cm) which are more standardized. Women's sizing relies more on arbitrary numbers that vary widely between brands."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I know if a brand runs small or large?",
        "answer": "Check customer reviews, look for fit feedback, and always consult the brand's specific size chart with body measurements. Many brands now indicate if items run small/large/true to size."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I size up when ordering from Asian brands?",
        "answer": "Often yes. Many Asian brands run 1-2 sizes smaller than Western brands. Always check the brand's measurement chart in centimeters and compare to your actual body measurements."
