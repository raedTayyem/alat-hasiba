They consider themselves the true keepers of the original Israelite religion, following the Torah and holding Mount Gerizim (not Jerusalem) as their holiest site.

                "answer": "The Metonic cycle is a period of 19 years after which the lunar phases recur on the same days of the solar year. Both Hebrew and Samaritan calendars use this cycle to determine when to add a 13th month (leap month), keeping the lunar calendar aligned with the seasons."
