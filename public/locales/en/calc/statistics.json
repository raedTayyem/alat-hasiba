      },
      {
        "question": "What does standard deviation tell me?",
        "answer": "Standard deviation measures how spread out your data is from the mean. A low standard deviation means data points cluster close to the mean, while a high standard deviation indicates wider spread. In a normal distribution, about 68% of data falls within 1 SD, 95% within 2 SDs, and 99.7% within 3 SDs of the mean."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is my variance so much larger than my standard deviation?",
        "answer": "Variance is the square of standard deviation, so it's always in squared units. For example, if your data is in meters and SD is 5m, variance would be 25m². Standard deviation is often preferred for interpretation because it's in the same units as your data."

        "answer": "Descriptive statistics fall into three categories: (1) Central tendency - mean, median, mode; (2) Dispersion - range, variance, standard deviation, IQR; (3) Position - quartiles, percentiles, z-scores. Together they summarize where data centers, how spread out it is, and where individual values fall."

      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics?",
        "answer": "Descriptive statistics summarize the data you have (this sample). Inferential statistics use sample data to make predictions or generalizations about a larger population. Descriptive statistics are always the first step before any inferential analysis."

      {
        "question": "How many data points do I need for reliable descriptive statistics?",
        "answer": "Basic statistics (mean, median) are meaningful with any sample size, but interpretation improves with more data. For quartiles and percentiles, at least 20-30 observations are recommended. For shape statistics (skewness, kurtosis), 50+ observations provide more reliable estimates."

      {
        "question": "Why use 50% for expected proportion?",
        "answer": "When you don't know the expected result, using 50% maximizes the sample size formula (p × (1-p) is maximum at p = 0.5). This ensures your sample will be large enough regardless of the actual result. If you have prior data suggesting a different proportion, using that value can reduce required sample size."

        "answer": "For large populations (over 100,000), population size barely affects sample size. For smaller populations, the finite population correction reduces required sample size. For example, to survey a company of 500 employees, you need fewer respondents than to survey a city of 1 million."
